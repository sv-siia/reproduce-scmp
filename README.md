## Team Member Responsibilities

- **Porimol Chandro:** Lead the (reproducible) implementation design plans.
- **Samidullo Abdullaev:** Data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Anastasiia Sviridova:** Reproduce and optimize machine learning models.
- **Shokoufeh Naseri:** Contributed to code refactoring, dataset preparation, Git workflow management, and implementation debugging to ensure successful reproduction of the original results.

## Subject of Research

Our project focuses on reproducing and evaluating the methodologies presented in the paper "Strategic Classification Made Practical" by Sagi Levanon and Nir Rosenfeld. This study addresses the challenges posed by strategic behavior in classification tasks, where individuals may alter their features to receive favorable outcomes. The authors propose a learning framework that directly minimizes the "strategic" empirical risk by differentiating through the strategic responses of users.

## Approach to Solving the Problem

1. **Literature Review:** Conduct an in-depth review of existing research on strategic classification to understand the theoretical foundations and current challenges.
2. **Reproducing the Paper's Framework:** Implement the strategic empirical risk minimization framework exactly as described in the paper, ensuring consistency with the original methodology.
3. **Dataset Selection:** Identify and preprocess datasets used in the paper (if available) or select similar datasets where strategic behavior is plausible.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train classification models using both traditional and strategic approaches, following the paperâ€™s experimental setup, and compare their performance.
5. **Validation and Analysis:** Analyze the reproduced results to assess whether they align with the findings in the paper and interpret the implications for real-world applications.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python 3.12.*
- **Package Dependency Manager:** [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** PyTorch, Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib.
- **Version Control:** Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/sv-siia/reproduce-scmp) for collaborative development and for source code version control.

## How to install and run?

At first install the `uv` python package manager, see more [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Clone the code repository as follows

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sv-siia/reproduce-scmp.git

# now change directory to the repository
cd reproduce-scmp
```

Install Python dependencies using `uv` package manager

```bash
uv sync
```

## Developer Installation (Editable mode)

To install the project as a developer package (editable mode), please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have installed the `uv` Python package manager. For installation instructions, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2. Install the project in editable mode by running the following command in the project directory:

   ```bash
   uv pip install --editable .
   ```

   This command will:
   - Install the project as a package in editable mode.
   - Allow you to make changes to the code and immediately use them without reinstalling.
   - Install all required dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

3. Verify the installation by running the CLI command:

   ```bash
   scmp --help
   ```

   This should display the help message for the `scmp` CLI tool, confirming that the package is installed and ready for development.

## Conclusion

By reimplementing the methodologies from `Strategic Classification Made Practical,` our project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical application in the field of strategic classification. This work will provide insights into the challenges and solutions associated with strategic behavior in machine learning models, contributing to the development of more robust and fair predictive systems.
